## Introduction

The `Token` contract highlights a critical vulnerability associated with integer underflows in Solidity. This challenge is designed to educate developers on the importance of secure arithmetic operations in smart contract development.

## Objective

The primary objective is to exploit the `Token` contract by bypassing its balance validation mechanism, enabling the transfer of more tokens than the sender's current balance.

## Background

The `Token` contract facilitates token transfers between users. However, the `transfer` function is flawed due to improper arithmetic handling, specifically when subtracting token amounts from the sender's balance.

## Vulnerability Analysis

The vulnerability stems from unchecked arithmetic in the `transfer` function. The line `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);` fails to prevent integer underflows. In Solidity, arithmetic operations wrap around on underflows, allowing an attacker to manipulate their balance and transfer tokens without sufficient funds.

## Exploitation Steps

Follow these steps to exploit the vulnerability:

1. Open the browser console (press `F12`) and execute a transfer where `_to` is any valid Ethereum address (e.g., one retrieved from Etherscan) and `_value` is set to `21`.

    ```javascript
    await contract.transfer('0xfb351a8fd42AC039ea79532Efa7481A233A1bacF', 21);
    ```

2. Verify the player's balance using the following command:

    ```javascript
    await contract.balanceOf(player);
    ```

    If the balance exceeds `20`, the exploit is successful, and the challenge is complete!!

## Conclusion

This challenge demonstrates the importance of understanding how arithmetic operations are handled in Solidity. While earlier versions of Solidity required developers to use libraries like `SafeMath` to prevent integer underflows and overflows, Solidity >= 0.8.0 includes built-in checks for these issues. However, this challenge serves as a reminder to carefully review contract logic and ensure that all edge cases are accounted for, even when using newer Solidity versions with improved safety features.
